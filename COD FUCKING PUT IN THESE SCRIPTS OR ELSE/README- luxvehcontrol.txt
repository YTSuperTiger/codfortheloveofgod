LUXART VEHICLE CONTROL - FOR FIVEM SERVERS
VER. 1.01 (MAY 01 2017)
Made by Lt.Caine

This server resource allows for synchronized ELS-style siren control and features, as well as synchronized indicator and hazard lights. It has been in use on the High-Speed Gaming server for several months and has proven effective.

The code is not the best, by any means. It was made while I was learning the basics of Lua and scripting for FiveM (in fact, I'm still learning). But, what's important is that it works and people enjoy using it.

Features:
- Does not affect or control emergency vehicle lighting.
- All features are synchronized for all players.
- Intuitive controller support (uses similar layout as ELS).
- Full siren and horn tone control (muted siren, manual tones, air horn, main siren tones, and auxiliary siren tone).
- Main siren will remain on when exiting the vehicle (this is intentional and meant to be realistic).
- Hazard and indicator light control.
- Indicators turn off automatically after a short delay (if the vehicle is moving).

Installation:
- (1) Place the lux_vehcontrol folder inside your server's resources folder.
- (2) Add lux_vehcontrol to your server's AutoStartResources in the citmp-server.yml file.

Notes:
- For additional information, see the client.lua file.
