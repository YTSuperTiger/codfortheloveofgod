Other Important Side Notes:All cars has takedowns and their own LED color headlights/taillights/halos 

Some cars are already lowered with the model, no need to change suspension.
These models are high poly and detailed, you will need gameconfig and a good PC to run them.
All cars have the same interior equipment.
Highly recommend to turn up brake light emissive in visualsettings.
I made the skins myself, inspired by the Brockport PD, license plates inspired by Alaska State Troopers.
Can't please everyone with this cars, I tried my best.
ALOT of time and much hours was put into each car.
Each car is meant to replace it's respected slot. Ex (CVPI-police Charger-police2 etc..)
All screenshots taken by me.
Some cars are bound to have bugs even with beta testing please DM me or comment, I will fix and update as much as I can.
Please do not ask me personally if I could modify a specific car just for your personal use, I'm open to suggestions, just will annoy me when you ask directly.
